      doYouDoConfiguration: {
        question: 'Do you also handle configuration and equipment?',
        answer: 'No. We do cabling and infrastructure work: pulling cables, terminating, labeling and functional testing. MSP/IT partners handle configuration and equipment management. This creates a clear separation between infrastructure (us) and configuration (MSP/IT).',

        question: 'Cat6 or Cat6A - what\'s the difference?',
        answer: 'Cat6A: 10 Gbps up to 100 meters (~500 MHz). Cat6: 10 Gbps up to ~55 meters (~250 MHz). Cat6A is more future-proof and better protected against EMI/crosstalk. For professional installations we usually recommend Cat6A.',

            question: 'What does data cabling cost per connection point?',

            question: 'What is the difference between a patch cabinet and a server rack?',
            answer: 'A patch cabinet mainly contains patch panels, switches and cable management for network cabling. A server rack contains servers and focuses more on cooling, power and security. Both often use the same 19-inch rack standard but with different configurations.',
          },
          {
            question: 'How much space do I need for a patch cabinet?',
            answer: 'That depends on the number of connection points. For 24-48 ports, a 12U wall cabinet is often sufficient. Larger installations (100+ points) require 42U floor racks. We always recommend 30% extra space for future expansions and cable management.',
          },
          {
            question: 'What is cable management and why is it important?',
            answer: 'Cable management consists of systems (channels, rings, bundles) that keep cables neat and structured. It prevents confusion, damage and airflow problems. Good cable management saves hours of work during maintenance and expansions because everything remains traceable.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Do you also supply the patch cabinet itself?',
            answer: 'No, we organize existing cabinets or work with cabinets supplied by you/MSP. We do advise on dimensions, specs and brands. This keeps our focus on craftsmanship: setup, cabling, labeling and documentation.',
          },
          {
            question: 'How important is airflow in a patch cabinet?',
            answer: 'Very important. Poor airflow leads to overheating of switches and equipment, which shortens lifespan and causes failures. We consider front/back routing, ventilation requirements and heat dissipation when setting up the cabinet.',
          },

            question: 'Can you clean up and reorganize existing patch cabinets?',

            question: 'Do you also install the cameras?',
            answer: 'No, we only do the cabling: pull UTP cables, terminate, test and label. Camera installation, configuration and setup is done by your security company. This ensures clear separation of responsibilities.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Which cable do you use for IP cameras?',
            answer: 'For IP cameras we use Cat6 or Cat6A UTP cables. These support PoE (Power over Ethernet) so the camera gets power and data via one cable. For outdoor runs we use outdoor-rated cables with extra protection.',
          },
          {
            question: 'What is PoE and why is it useful?',
            answer: 'PoE (Power over Ethernet) means an IP camera receives both data and power via one UTP cable. This saves pulling separate power cables and makes placement flexible. You do need a PoE switch or injector to supply the power.',
          },
          {
            question: 'How far can a camera cable run?',
            answer: 'The maximum distance for Cat6/Cat6A cabling is 100 meters (from switch to camera). For longer distances you can use fiber optic, PoE extenders or additional switches. We always advise on feasible distances during design.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Can you also pull outdoor camera cabling?',
            answer: 'Yes, we also pull outdoor cables. We use outdoor-rated Cat6/Cat6A with UV-resistant jacket and extra protection against moisture. Cables are neatly concealed in conduits, pipes or installed underground.',
          },
          {
            question: 'How many cameras can a PoE switch power?',
            answer: 'This depends on the switch capacity and the cameras. A standard PoE camera uses 4-15 Watts. A 24-port PoE switch typically has a 120-370 Watt budget. Always calculate a 20% margin for future expansions.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Do I receive documentation of the camera cabling?',
            answer: 'Yes, always. You receive a handover package with test reports, cable plan, labeling scheme and photos of the final installation. This way your security company knows exactly which cable goes where and can connect cameras immediately.',

            question: 'What are balanced lines?',

            question: 'Which cable do you use for audio cables?',

          {
            question: 'How do you prevent interference on audio cables?',
            answer: 'We keep distance from power cables, fluorescent lighting and other interference sources. Balanced cabling with shielding helps suppress interference. We also avoid parallel routing with high-voltage cables and ensure proper grounding.',

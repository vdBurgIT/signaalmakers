            question: 'Do you also handle network configuration?',
            answer: 'No, we only do the cable work: pulling cables, terminating, labeling and certifying. MSP/IT partners handle the configuration of switches, VLANs and network equipment. This ensures clear responsibilities and professional end results.',

            question: 'Do you provide test reports?',

            question: 'What does data cabling cost per connection point?',
            answer: 'The price depends on the number of points, cable length, building type and accessibility. As an indication: expect €75-150 per point including materials, installation and certification. Request a quote for an exact price.',

          {
            question: 'How much space do I need for a patch cabinet?',
            answer: 'That depends on the number of connection points. For 24-48 ports, a 12U wall cabinet is often sufficient. Larger installations (100+ points) require 42U floor racks. We always recommend 30% extra space for future expansions and cable management.',
          },
          {
            question: 'What is cable management and why is it important?',
            answer: 'Cable management consists of systems (channels, rings, bundles) that keep cables neat and structured. It prevents confusion, damage and airflow problems. Good cable management saves hours of work during maintenance and expansions because everything remains traceable.',
          },
          {
            question: 'Do you also supply the patch cabinet itself?',

          },
          {
            question: 'How important is airflow in a patch cabinet?',
            answer: 'Very important. Poor airflow leads to overheating of switches and equipment, which shortens lifespan and causes failures. We consider front/back routing, ventilation requirements and heat dissipation when setting up the cabinet.',
          },

            question: 'Can you clean up and reorganize existing patch cabinets?',

            question: 'What does cleaning up a patch cabinet cost?',
